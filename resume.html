            <p>
                I am a second-year undergraduate at Texas A&M University,
                studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I am incredibly
                interested in the intersection of computational methods, such as ML/AI,
                in areas of scientific research, where I hope to use my skills to contribute
                to drug discovery.
                <br /><br />
                To this end, I am minoring in Chemistry and planning to minor in Statistics.
                I am also an active member of a research group, the <a href="https://www.dtaborgroup.com">Tabor Group</a>, where I am
                working on ML models for disordered proteins.

            <p>
                I focus on machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, for solving problems with big data.
                I am skilled at using NumPy/Pandas and am currently using PyTorch to train machine learning models
                for my research project. Additionally, I am taking coursework in machine learning and probability, which will
                further strengthen my data science skills.
                <br /><br />
                I am also well-versed in full-stack web development, particularly using frameworks such as ReactJs/NextJS,
                Express, and ThreeJS. I enjoy building fun and interactive applications to solve problems. My view is that
                the important problems can be solved with data science, but the ability to access these solutions must come from
                elegant and intelligently designed user interfaces.
                <br /><br />
                Thus, one can think of me as a data scientist with a passion for user-friendly applications. Though this may seem
                a lack of focus, I believe having a varied skillset combined with a "sharp" focus on one area allows for the greatest
                accomplishment and the most unique products. Wherever I end up, it is my hope that I can make a difference to the world
                through a means that applies the use of my skills.

            <div class="island-title">Experience</div>
            <p>Here are some of the experiences I've had:</p>
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    I have been active in research for both years of my undergraduate studies.
                </li>
                <li>
                    More coming soon...
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <p>
                I haven't had an internship yet, but I am planning to do one next summer in a data-science related role: in particular,
                I am interested in an REU-related program or a summer internship at a pharmaceutical/biotechnology company. In the meantime,
                I amd honing my machine learning skills as well as my mathematical/computational skills. I am also taking coursework in the
                field that I am interested in: computational chemistry (specifically, I am enrolled in Physical Chemistry 2). It is my hope
                that having a further developed level of domain knowledge will allow me to apply machine learning to real-world chemical/biological
                problems more effectively in my career.
