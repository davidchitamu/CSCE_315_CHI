            I am a second-year undergraduate at Texas A&M University,
            studying Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I am incredibly
            interested in the intersection of computational methods, such as ML/AI,
            in areas of scientific research, where I hope to use my skills to contribute
            to drug discovery.
            
            To this end, I am minoring in Chemistry and planning to minor in Statistics.
            I am also an active member of a research group, the Tabor Group, where I am
            working on ML models for disordered proteins.

            I focus on machine learning, particularly deep learning methods, for solving problems with big data.
            I am skilled at using NumPy/Pandas and am learning to use PyTorch.

            I am also well-versed in full-stack web development, particularly using frameworks such as ReactJs/NextJS,
            Express, and ThreeJS. I enjoy building fun and interactive applications to solve problems. My view is that
            the important problems can be solved with data science, but the ability to access these solutions must come from
            elegant and intelligently designed user interfaces.
